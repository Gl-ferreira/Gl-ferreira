### About Me:

- As an **Actuarial Analyst** at **WTW Portugal**, I support pension **risk forecasting** through statistical analysis and large-scale data handling. I collaborate with German project experts and use Excel and MySQL to deliver consistent multi-company evaluations and **actionable insights**.

- Iâ€™m a second-year MSc student in **Data Science and Advanced Analytics**. Growing up on Madeira Island, I experienced the **real-world impact of energy challenges**, a perspective that now drives my thesis: *Forecasting the Distribution of Renewable Energy Sourcesâ€™ Production in Madeira Island* to support **sustainable energy planning** and reduce the island's reliance on fossil fuels.

- I hold a BSc degree in **Management** from CatÃ³lica Porto Business School.

- Driven by a passion for **Python**, **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, **AI** and **Energy**, I strive to build innovative **solutions** that make a **meaningful impact**.

- Fluent in **Portuguese** and **English**; currently at **B1** level in **German** and actively improving through WTWâ€™s internal language program.
