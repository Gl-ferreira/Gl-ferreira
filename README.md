### About Me:
- As an Actuarial Analyst at WTW Portugal on the Germany Evaluations Team, I support pension risk forecasting through statistical analysis and large-scale data handling. I work with German documentation, collaborate with project experts, and deliver consistent multi-company evaluations using Excel and MySQL to extract and communicate valuable insights.

- Iâ€™m a second-year MSc student in Data Science and Advanced Analytics, specializing in Business Analytics. Growing up on Madeira Island, I experienced the real-world impact of energy challenges, a perspective that now drives my thesis: *"Forecasting the Distribution of Renewable Energy Sourcesâ€™ Production in Madeira Island,"* where I apply data-driven methods to support sustainable energy planning and reduce the island's reliance on fossil fuels.

- I hold a BSc degree in **Management** from CatÃ³lica Porto Business School.

- Driven by a passion for Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, and Energy, I strive to build innovative solutions that make a meaningful impact.

- Fluent in Portuguese and English; currently at B1 level in German and actively improving through WTWâ€™s internal language program.
